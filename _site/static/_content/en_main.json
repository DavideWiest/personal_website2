Over the years many options have popped up for the sophisticated entrepreneur, and the ways to make a website are as diverse as ever. However, a website still must look appealing and be functional at all times. This is where I want to help.",

        "Developer": "With over 3 years of experience in Python, I have developed a great passion for programming. Sometimes, when I'm in 'the Zone', I even forget to eat and drink. I mainly program websites and webapps, but I'm also open to new things.",
        "Designer": "I always enjoy designing things: I find designs that tell a clear story to be compelling, as I think many others do, in an elementary way. It is all the more fulfilling to see that a design shows the desired impact and thus enables a deeper relationship between the viewer and the environment.",
        "Strategist": "Important decisions have to be made in those fields of work. You have to keep in mind how small decisions affect the big picture and shape future room for maneuver. So when I look at a problem, I take the time I need to find a good solution."
