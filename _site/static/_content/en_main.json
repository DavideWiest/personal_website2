    "heroText": "Today, the opportunities for the dedicated entrepreneur to create a website are more diverse than ever. However, hardly any entrepreneur has enough time to learn design and development alongside their actual work, which is required to create a compelling website. This is where I, Davide Wiest, want to help.",

    "aboutContent": {
        "Developer": "With over 3 years of experience in Python, I have developed a great passion for programming. Sometimes, when I'm in 'the Zone', I even forget to eat and drink. I specialize in full-stack web development, but I'm also open to new things.",
        "Designer": "I always enjoy designing things: I find designs that tell a clear story to be compelling, as I think many others do, in an elementary way. It is all the more fulfilling to see that a design shows the desired impact and thus enables a deeper relationship between the viewer and the environment.",
        "Strategist": "Important decisions have to be made in those fields of work. You have to keep in mind how small decisions affect the big picture and shape future room for maneuver. So when I look at a problem, I take the time I need to find a good solution.",
        "Freelancer": "Since June 2022 I have decided that I want to put my skills to use on a freelance basis. If you are looking for someone who knows about web development or graphic design, I look forward to your contact email."

        "03": ["Creation", "We/I make the project reality. In design projects, this happens relatively quickly. For websites, I design the rough user interface first. This allows you to raise objections directly and contribute your own opinion. Only after that comes the more time-extensive development process."],
        "04": ["Deployment", "Finally, the project must be deployed or integrated. If it's a website, you can host and maintain it yourself, or I'll do it for a monthly fee. The first 3 months of hosting/maintenance will be free for you."]
